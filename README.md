# reddit-comment-section


## todo
 make a seperate function for appending the comment, 
 so it can be reused for comments too
 if in the forEach loop, it finds comments to be a non empty array, 
 for every reply on the comment run the reply append function
determine if its a reply by passing it on as a boolean

makes little sense i know but it makes sense to me : )
